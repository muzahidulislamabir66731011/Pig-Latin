# Pig Latin Converter

A simple Python program that converts English words into Pig Latin.

## What is Pig Latin?

Pig Latin is a fun word game where English words are transformed based on these rules:

- If the word starts with a **vowel** (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`), add `"way"` to the end.
- If the word starts with a **consonant**, move the first letter to the end and add `"ay"`.

### Examples:
apple -> appleway
python -> ythonpay
